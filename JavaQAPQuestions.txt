Instructions:
You are allowed to complete the assessment problems below in whatever way you can but please answer the following questions/points as part of your submission:
1.	How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)
- I spent around 8 or 9 hours on it (Things didn't want to work lol). The third problem was really difficult and definitely took me around 4hrs.

2.	What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)
- Lectures, Youtube, Stack overflow, geeksforgeeks, FreeCodeCamp, Google, O'Reilly, and W3Schools

3.	Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)
- No, I didn't ask for any help

4.	Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?
- No, I didn't ask instructors any questions.

5.	Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.
- Its okay, I'm still confused but that is because I've always struggled with math. The third problem was the most difficult.
